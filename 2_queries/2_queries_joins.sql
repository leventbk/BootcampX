-- Get the total amount of time that all students from a specific cohort have spent on all assignments.
-- This should work for any cohort but use FEB12 for now.
-- Select only the total amount of time as a single column.
-- You can write as many JOIN statements as you need in a single query. Expected Result:
-- 
-- total_duration 
-- ----------------
--          373501
-- (1 row)

SELECT sum(assignment_submissions.duration) as total_duration
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
JOIN cohorts ON cohorts.id = cohort_id
WHERE cohorts.name = 'FEB12';
